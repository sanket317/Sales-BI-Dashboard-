## Overview üåü
This project involves:

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Using Power Query to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Creating relationships between tables and building a robust data model.
- **DAX Calculations**: Implementing complex calculations using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
- **Visualizations**: Designing interactive and insightful dashboards to analyze sales, profit, orders, and more.

The final dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, profitability, and trends over time.

## Objectives üéØ
The objectives of this project are:

1. **Calculate Total Sales**: Display the total sales value for the selected period.
2. **Calculate Profit**: Visualize the total profit achieved based on sales data.
3. **Analyze Orders**: Analyze the number of orders placed during the selected period.
4. **Calculate Profit Margin**: Calculate and visualize the profit margin percentage.
5. **Compare Sales by Product with Previous Year**: Highlight growth or decline in sales for each product.
6. **Compare Sales by Months with Previous Year**: Identify regions with significant changes in sales.
7. **Display Top 5 Cities**: Showcase the top 5 cities based on sales.
8. **Compare Profit by Channel with Previous Year**: Analyze profitability by sales channel.
9. **Analyze Sales by Customer**: Compare individual customer performance with the previous year.
10. **Create Slicers**: Enable dynamic filtering by date, city, product, and channel.

## Data Sources üìÇ
The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Sales Data**: Contains information about sales, profit, orders, and other relevant metrics.
- **Date Table**: A custom date table created for time intelligence calculations.

## Steps üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Gather Data**
   - Collect and validate data from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or web services.

2. **Power Query ‚Äì Data Extract, Transform & Load**
   - Clean and transform data using Power Query (remove duplicates, handle missing values, merge datasets, create calculated columns).

3. **Create a Date Table**
   - Build a custom date table to enable time intelligence calculations in DAX.
   - Turn off "Auto Date/Time" in Power BI settings to improve report performance.

4. **Create Data Model in Power BI Desktop**
   - Design a data model representing relationships between tables.

5. **Develop Reports in Power BI Desktop**
   - Create reports and dashboards using charts, tables, and maps.
   - Apply filters, slicers, and drill-through functionalities.

6. **Implement DAX Calculations**
   - Use DAX to create calculated columns, measures, and tables for advanced computations.

7. **Create Visualizations**
   - **Sales by Product**: Compared with the previous year.
   - **Sales by Month**: Compared with the previous year.
   - **Top 5 Cities by Sales**.
   - **Profit by Channel**: Compared with the previous year.
   - **Sales by Customer**: Compared with the previous year.
   - **Cards**: Displaying Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, and Products Sold.

## Technologies Used üíª
- **Power BI**: For data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For advanced calculations and measures.

## DAX Measures üìù
### Total Sales
```DAX
Sales = SUM(Sales_Data[Sales])
```
### Previous Year Total Sales
```DAX
Sales PY = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
```
### Difference Between Current Year Sales & Previous Year Sales
```DAX
Sales vs PY = [Sales] - [Sales PY]
```
### Percentage Increase or Decrease in Sales Year on Year (YOY%)
```DAX
Sales vs PY % = DIVIDE([Sales vs PY], [Sales], 0)
```
### Products Sold
```DAX
Products Sold = SUM(Sales_Data[Order Quantity])
```
### Profit
```DAX
Profit = SUM(Sales_Data[Profit])
```
### Profit Last Year
```DAX
Profit LY = CALCULATE([Profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
```
### Profit vs Last Year
```DAX
Profit vs LY = [Profit] - [Profit LY]
```
### Profit vs Last Year Percentage
```DAX
Profit vs LY % = DIVIDE([Profit vs LY], [Profit], 0)
```
### Profit Margin
```DAX
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit], [Sales], 0)
```
### Total Cost
```DAX
Total Cost = SUM(Sales_Data[Total Cost])
```

## Visualizations üìä
- **Sales by Product**: Compared with the previous year.
- **Sales by Month**: Compared with the previous year.
- **Top 5 Cities by Sales**.
- **Profit by Channel**: Compared with the previous year.
- **Sales by Customer**: Compared with the previous year.
- **Cards**: Displaying Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, and Products Sold.

## Conclusion üìù
### Key Insights for the Year 2019:
- Sales decreased by more than 10%.
- There is a drop in sales for all the top 7 products.
- 4 customers are leading to a drop in sales.
- The profit margin in the Export channel is higher.
